```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # on Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Application Under Test

The test app (`mda-2.2.0-25.apk`) is located in the `app/` folder

No need to download anything manually — the tests use this file directly.

---

##  Running Tests

Make sure your **Appium server** and **Android emulator (or device)** are running:

```bash
appium
```

Then, in another terminal:
```bash
pytest -s -v --alluredir=reports
```

Or to run a specific test module:
```bash
pytest tests/test_login.py -v --alluredir=allure-reports
```
##  Allure Report

Generate and open the Allure report:
```bash
allure serve allure-eports
```


##  Reporting & Stability

- Each test uses explicit waits (no hard sleeps).

- Page Object Model (POM) ensures maintainability.

- Allure steps provide detailed step-by-step reports.

- Flaky reruns are configured for unstable cases.

- Screenshots on failure are attached in Allure reports.

##  Notes for Reviewer

- The APK (app/mydemoapp.apk) is already included — no manual download needed.

- The full suite executes in ~1 minute on a standard emulator.
- ```allure-report``` directory and screenshot of test run results are committed for demo proposes
